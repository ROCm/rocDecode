rocDecode prerequisites
********************************************************************

rocDecode requires ROCm 6.1 or later running on `accelerators based on the CDNA architecture <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html>`_.

ROCm must be installed using the AMDGPU installer with the ``rocm`` usecase:

.. code:: shell

  sudo amdgpu-install --usecase=rocm

rocDecode has been tested on the following Linux environments:
  
* Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04
* RHEL 8 and 9
* SLES 15 SP7

See `Supported operating systems <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#supported-operating-systems>`_ for the complete list of ROCm supported Linux environments.

The following prerequisites are installed by the package installer. If you are building and installing using the source code, use the `rocDecode-setup.py <https://github.com/ROCm/rocDecode/blob/develop/rocDecode-setup.py>`_ to install these prerequisites. 

.. note:: 

  To use the rocDecode samples, the ``rocdecode``, ``rocdecode-dev``, and ``rocdecode-test`` packages need to be installed.
  
  If you're installing using the rocDecode source code, the ``rocDecode-setup.py`` script must be run with ``--developer`` set to ``ON``.
