## Decoding the frame using rocDecDecodeFrame()
After de-muxing and parsing, the next step is to decode bitstream data containing a frame/field using hardware. `rocDecDecodeFrame()` API is to submit a new frame for hardware decoding. Underneath the driver, VA-API is used to submit compressed picture data to the driver. The parser extracts all the necessary information from the bitstream and fills the "RocdecPicParams" struct which is appropriate for the codec used. The high-level `RocVideoDecoder` class connects the parser and decoder which is used for all the sample applications.
The `rocDecDecodeFrame()` call takes the decoder handle and the pointer to RocdecPicParams structure and kicks off video decoding using VA-API.
